/*
 * ðŸš€ What is Callback Hell ?

 *    Callback hell is nothing special it is just one callback function inside the another callback functions. And, it is also know as "Pyramid of DOOM".
 * 
 * ðŸš€ Inversion of Control : Losing the control on our code because we pass our code inside another function.
